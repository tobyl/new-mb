                <p>Check for any bits of bone missed by the butcher, and ensure that there are no bits of fat or loose hanging off.</p>

                  <p>Before we add the cure we'll place our meat in the bag we'll be using for the cure. This can be a ziploc bag, but you'll have to make sure you seal the bag and remove as much of the air as possible.</p>

                <Article id="second">
                  <p>Now for the important part: Measuring the ingredients for the cure. You'll end up with a small amount of curing salt - I ended up with around 3 or 4 grams for this piece. A little goes a long way!</p>
                  <p>We'll be dealing with very small quantities, so you can safely round up to the nearest gram (some of the cure will end up stuck to your hands anyway). For this piece I ended up with around 20g of salt and around 10g of sugar.</p>

                  <p>Early on we recommend keeping your ingredients simple. Salt, sugar and curing salt will give you a pretty standard bacon flavour. Once you are comfortable with the process you can tweak the recipe and add your own flavours.</p>

                  <p>Stir the mixture carefully, especially the curing salt. We will be applying this directly to the meat, so we want it to be consistent.</p>

                  <p>You might think that you've ended up with a small amount of cure for the piece of meat, but don't worry. As you'll see later on, everything will eventually equalize (hence the name of the EQ curing process!).</p>

                  <p>Pour around half of the cure into the bag on to the surface of the meat and massage until the cure evenly covers the first side. Flip the bag over and apply the remaining cure to the other side.</p>

                  <p>Try not to spill any. Remember, this method relies on us being fairly precise in our measurements and we want all of the cure in the bag.</p>

                  <p>When sealing the bag, we want a sung fit but it doesn't need to be the full vacuum. Bear in mind that the process works by removing moisture and replacing it with our cure, so we want a tiny bit of movement inside the bag.</p>

                  <p>Our meat is now prepared! Into the fridge it goes to begin the curing process. It's a good idea to massage the meat once sealed to encourage the cure to dissolve and dissipate.</p>

                  <p>You'll notice fairly early on that the cure is already dissolving and moisture will be accumulating in the bag. This is a good sign!</p>
